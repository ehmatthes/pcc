Creating a Virtual Environment
---

To work with Django, it's best to first set up a virtual environment. A virtual environment is a place on your system where you can install packages for one project and isolate those packages from the rest of your system. Using this approach, you can have many projects on your system without worrying about one project's packages interfering with another project's packages. Every project can have the exact version of the packages it needs, and you can update any one project's packages without affecting your other projects.

To get set up for Learning Log, make sure you have an empty folder somewhere on your system called *learning_log*.

If you're using Python 3, you should be able to create a virtual environment with the following command:

    learning_log$ python -m venv ll_env
    learning_log$

This command runs the *venv* module and uses it to create a virtual environment named ll_env.

If this works, move on to [Activating the Virtual Environment](#activating-the-virtual-environment). If it didn't work, go to [Installing virtualenv](#installing-virtualenv).

Activating the Virtual Environment
---

Now that you have a virtual environment set up, you'll need to activate it. On Linux and OS X, use the following command:

    learning_log$ source ll_env/bin/activate
    (ll_env)learning_log$

On Windows, run the following equivalent command:

    learning_log> ll_env\Scripts\activate
    (ll_env)learning_log>

This command runs the script *activate*, which is located in *ll_env/bin*. When the environment is active, you'll see the name of the environment in parentheses. This means you can install packages to the environment and use packages that have already been installed. Packages you install in *ll_env* will be available only when the environment is active; if you run into errors, make sure you see *(ll_env)* in parentheses at the beginng of your terminal prompt. If you don't see it, issue the *activate* command again.

###Deactivating the virtual environment

To stop using a virtual environment, enter **deactivate**:

    (ll_env)learning_log$ deactivate
    learning_log$

The environment will also become inactive if you close the terminal it's running in.

Installing virtualenv
---

If you're using an earlier version of Python or if your system isn't set up to use the *venv* module correctly, you can install the *virtualenv* package. To install virtualenv, enter the following:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    $ pip install --user virtualenv.

You may use pip in a slightly different manner on your system; see [installing Python Packages](../chapter_12/installing_pip.html) if you need help using pip.
=======
    $ pip install --user virtualenv

You may use pip in a slightly different manner on your system; see [installing Python Packages](../chapter_12/installing_pip.md) if you need help using pip.
>>>>>>> 7d67f0238b7c252b7959ba1f2b5516064ac05a7c

If you're using Linux and this still doesn't work, you can install virtualenv through your system's package manager. On Ubuntu, for example, the command **sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv** will install virtualenv.

### Creating a virtual environment with virtualenv

Change to the *learning_log* directory in a terminal, and create a virtual environment like this:

    learning_log$ virtualenv ll_env
    New python executable in ll_env/bin/python
    Installing setuptools, pip...done.
    learning_log$

If this works, move on to [Activating the virtual environment](#activating-the-virtual-environment).

If you have more than one version of Python installed on your system, you should specify the version for virtualenv to use. For example, the command **virtualenv ll_env --python=python3** wil create a virtual environment that uses Python 3.

Installing Django
---

In an active virtual environment, you can use pip to install Django:

    (ll_env)learning_log$ pip install Django
    Installing collected packages: Django
    Successfully installed Django
    Cleaning up...
    (ll_env)learning_log$

Because this command is run in a virtual environment, it's the same on all operating systems. There's no need to use the `--user` flag, and there's no need to use longer commands like `python -m pip install django`.

Keep in mind that Django will only be available when the virtual environment is active.

### Installing a specific version of Django

Django 2.0 introduced some changes that affect the Learning Log project. The updates described below will allow you to run the project in the latest version of Django, but you can also install the previous version if you want to match what's in the book exactly.

To do this, specify the version of Django you want to install when you use pip:

    (ll_env)learning_log$ pip install Django==1.11
    Collecting Django==1.11
    Installing collected packages: pytz, Django
    Successfully installed Django-1.11 pytz-2017.3

This should work even if you've already install a different version of Django. When you ask pip to install a specific version of a library, it will uninstall any other versions first.

Updates
---

Django 2.0 was released recently, and there are a number of changes that affect the Learning Log project. The overall changes are described briefly, and then specific updates to the chapter are listed.

### Overview

Here's an overview of recent changes to Django:

- Foreign keys need an explicit `on_delete=models.CASCADE` argument set. This was set by default in previous versions. When a user deletes a topic in their learning log, the `on_delete` argument tells Django what to do with the entries in that topic. The `CASCADE` value tells Django to delete any entries associated with a topic that's being deleted.

- There's a new way to define the `namespace` for an app's URLs. Rather than setting the namespace in the project's *urls.py* file, the namespace is set in each app's *urls.py*.

- There's a simpler approach to defining URLs. In previous versions, you had to write a regular expression for any URL that included an identifier, such as http://localhost:8000/topics/1/. This new approach is not required, but you'll probably appreciate it and want to know about it.

- The `reverse()` function has been moved from `django.core.urlresolvers` to the `django.urls` module.

- Django 2.0 only works with Python 3. If you're still using Python 2.7, you'll need to [install Django 1.11](#installing-a-specific-version-of-django).

### Checking which version of Django you're using

The command `pip freeze` lists the specific versions of all packages you have installed in a virtual environment. To see which version of Django you're using, make sure you're in an active virtual environment, and then issue this command:

    (ll_env)learning_log$ pip freeze
    Django==2.0
    pytz==2017.3

If you decide you'd rather use the previous version of Django so you can ignore these updates for now, you can install Django 1.11 [as described above](#installing-a-specific-version-of-django).

### Specific updates

Here are the specific changes to look out for in Chapter 17. It might look like there's a lot of changes, but once you start working through the project you'll see that many of these changes follow a consistent pattern. If you have any trouble with this that you can't resolve, please reach out for help ([ehmatthes@gmail.com](mailto:ehmatthes@gmail.com) or [@ehmatthes](http://twitter.com/ehmatthes/))

### p. 402, *Figure 18-1*

The default home page for a new Django project has been updated, and it's beautiful!

![The default home page for a new Django project]({{ site.url }}/pcc/chapter_18/default_homepage.png)

### p. 408, *Defining the Entry Model*

Replace the line that reads

    topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic)

with

    topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

This tells Django that when a topic is deleted, all of the entries associated with that topic should be deleted as well. This is known as a cascading delete.

### p. 413, *Mapping a URL*

When you start a project in Django 2.0, this is what you'll see in the project's main *urls.py* file:

	from django.contrib import admin
	from django.urls import path

	urlpatterns = [
	    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
	]

Django 2.0 introduces a new `path()` function that simplifies how we define URLs. The older `url()` approach still works, but in these updates I'll show you how to use the new `path()` function.

Here's how to include the URLs for the `learning_logs` app:

	from django.urls import path, include
	from django.contrib import admin

	urlpatterns = [
	    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
	    path('', include('learning_logs.urls')),
	]

The `include()` function is now imported from the `django.urls` module. Since the new URL routing approach doesn't require regular expressions, we don't need to include a carat at the beginning of the URL string. We also don't need to include a `namespace` argument in the `include()` call; that will be specified in the app's *urls.py* in a moment.

Here's what the *learning_logs/urls.py* file should look like:

	"""Defines url patterns for learning_logs."""

	from django.urls import path

	from . import views

	app_name = 'learning_logs'
	urlpatterns = [
	    # Home page.
	    path('', views.index, name='index'),
	]

We need to import the new `path()` function from `django.urls`. In Django 2.0, the app's namespace is defined through an `app_name` variable in the app's *urls.py*. Finally, the URL pattern for the home page is simpler without the need to define a regular expression.

### p. 419, *The Topics URL Pattern*

The topics URL pattern should look like this:

	urlpatterns = [
	    --snip--
	    # Show all topics.
	    path('topics/', views.topics, name='topics'),
	]

### p. 422, *The Topic URL Pattern*

The topic URL pattern should look like this:

	urlpatterns = [
	    --snip--
	    # Detail page for a single topic.
        path('topics/<int:topic_id>/', views.topic, name='topic'),
	]

In this new `path()`-based approach you figure out what you want the URL to look like:

    http://localhost:8000/topics/5/

Then you write this as a string, with any variables in the URL inside angle brackets. In the angle brackets you describe the type of variable to expect, `int` in this case, and provide a name for the value in the URL. This is much simpler than writing a regular expression to capture the value in the URL.
