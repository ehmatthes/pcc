Python Crash Course - Cheat Sheets
===

A cheat sheet can be really helpful when you're trying a set of exercises related to a specific topic, or working on a project. 
Because you can only fit so much information on a single sheet of paper, most cheat sheets are a simple listing of syntax rules. This set of cheat sheets aims to remind you of syntax rules, but also remind you of important concepts as well.

You can download any individual cheat sheet, or download all the cheat sheets in [one document](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc/raw/master/cheat_sheets/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_all.pdf).
