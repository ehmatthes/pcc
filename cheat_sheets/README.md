Python Crash Course - Cheat Sheets
===

A cheat sheet can be really helpful when you're trying a set of exercises related to a specific topic, or working on a project. 
Because you can only fit so much information on a single sheet of paper, most cheat sheets are a simple listing of syntax rules. This set of cheat sheets aims to remind you of syntax rules, but also remind you of important concepts as well.
